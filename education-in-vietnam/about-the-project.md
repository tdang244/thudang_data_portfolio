# About the Project

This project is inspired by a course I taught on Research and Data Analytics to high school and university students in Vietnam during Summer 2020. 

I would love to share the findings from the data, the visualizations, as well as the codes I used during the course. As the data are public data and need a lot of data cleaning and wrangling, I have honed these skills significantly during this project.
