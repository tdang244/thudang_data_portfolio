# About me

My name is Thu Dang (pronounced like 'too dang') and I am an aspiring Data Scientist.

I'm currently studying Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Computer Science, and Community and Global Health at Macalester College.&#x20;

During my gap year in 2020 - 2021, I was Summer Analytics Consultant at Deloitte Consulting in Singapore.

Before Deloitte, I have challenged myself in various scopes of work, ranging from strategy, consulting, and data analytics, and also in different industries. Some of my milestones are:

* 2019: Strategy and Insights Intern at Mindshare, a leading global media agency&#x20;
* 2020: Data Analytics Intern at MoMo, a leading fintech company in Vietnam
* 2021: Case Team Assistant at Boston Consulting Group (BCG)

As I discover my passion in the business aspects of consulting as well as the analytical mindset in data analytics, I would love to combine these in the prospects of delivering data-driven insights for business problems.

I am well-versed in R, Python, SQL (BigQuery), and DataStudio. During Deloitte, I also get acquainted with Google Cloud Platform and its services, including Cloud Run, Workflows, and BigQuery.
