# About me

My name is Thu Dang (pronounced like 'too dang') and I am an aspiring Data Scientist.

I'm currently studying Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a concentration in Community and Global Health at Macalester College.&#x20;

This past summer, Summer 2022, I got an opportunity to be a Data Scientist Intern at an NYC-based startup called Up\&Up - a Series B tech-enabled real estate startup that helps renters build wealth like owners, backed by Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, and strategic angels from Opendoor, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Millennium.

Before this internship, I've accumulated my skillset in various internships, ranging from analytics to consulting. Some of my milestones are:

* 2021: Summer Analytics Consultant at Deloitte Consulting in Singapore
* 2021: Case Team Assistant at Boston Consulting Group (BCG)
* 2020: Data Analytics Intern at MoMo, a tech unicorn in Vietnam
* 2019: Strategy and Insights Intern at Mindshare, a leading global media agency&#x20;

As I discover my passion in the intersection of business and data analytics, I would love to combine my skills in these fields in order to deliver data-driven insights for business problems.

I am well-versed in R, Python, SQL (BigQuery), and DataStudio. During Deloitte, I also get acquainted with Google Cloud Platform and its services, including Cloud Run, Workflows, and BigQuery. At Up\&Up, I gained more knowledge in Retool - a website building service - and different visualization platforms such as Mode and Metabase.
