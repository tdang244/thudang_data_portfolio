## Education in Vietnam

### About my project

I taught a Research and Data Analytics course to high school and university students in Vietnam during Summer 2020. I would love to share the findings from the data, the visualizations, as well as the codes I used during the course. As the data are public data and need a lot of data cleaning and wrangling, I have honed these skills significantly during this project. 

### About me

My name is Thu. I am an aspiring analytic consulting, and I'm currently an Analytic Consulting Intern at Deloitte Consulting in Singapore. Before this, I have worked in data analytics at MoMo, a leading e-Wallet company in Vietnam, and in consulting at Boston Consulting Group \(BCG\). As I love the business aspects of consulting as well as the analytical mindset in data analytics, I would love to combine these in the prospects of helping businesses scale with data-driven insights.
