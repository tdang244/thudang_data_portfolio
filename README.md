# About me

My name is Thu Dang \(pronounced like 'too dang'\) and I am an aspiring analytic consultant.

I'm currently a Summer Analytics Consultant at Deloitte Consulting in Singapore.

I am also a rising junior at Macalester College in Minnesota, studying Applied Mathematics & Statistics \(major\), Computer Science \(minor\), and Community & Global Health \(concentration\).

Before Deloitte, I have challenged myself in various scopes of work, ranging from strategy, consulting, and data analytics, and also in different industries. Some of my milestones are:

* 2019: Strategy and Insights Intern at Mindshare, a leading global media agency 
* 2020: Data Analytics Intern at MoMo, a leading fintech company in Vietnam
* 2021: Case Team Assistant at Boston Consulting Group \(BCG\)

As I discover my passion in the business aspects of consulting as well as the analytical mindset in data analytics, I would love to combine these in the prospects of delivering data-driven insights for business problems.

I am well-versed in R, Python, SQL \(BigQuery\), and DataStudio. During Deloitte, I also get acquainted with Google Cloud Platform and its services.
