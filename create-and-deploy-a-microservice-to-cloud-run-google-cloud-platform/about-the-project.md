# About the Project

### Context

In my project at Deloitte, I was tasked with creating a validation microservice with 20+ checks that investigate whether there are outliers in the data or not.

### Goals

My goal in this blog is to document and reflect upon the process, in which I significantly hone my Python skills, learn how to package my scripts into a microservice, and build a dynamic dashboard to monitor the outlier status.
