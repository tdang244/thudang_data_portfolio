# About the Project

During my time as a data analytics intern at MoMo - the leading fintech company in Vietnam, it is vital that I understand our customer segments and their particular behaviors based on our data. Such knowledge enables the data team to recommend data-driven strategies to business and product functions, using which they can direct their resources to target different groups of customers more effectively, especially in terms of cost. 

This project is a learning opportunity for me to hone my customer segmentation skill using one of the most popular clustering techniques out there, which is **K-Means clustering**.
