# About the Project

### Context

During my time as a data analytics intern at MoMo - the leading fintech company in Vietnam, it is vital that I understand our customer segments and their particular behaviors based on our data. Such knowledge enables the data team to recommend data-driven strategies to business and product functions, using which they can direct their resources to target different groups of customers more effectively, especially in terms of cost. 

This project is a learning opportunity for me to hone my customer segmentation skill using one of the most popular clustering techniques out there, which is **K-Means clustering**. 

I have obtained this skill through the Machine Learning A-Z course on Udemy and hope to see see the techniques in action in this experience. 

### Goals

By the end of this project, I hope to: 

* Segment the customer into separate groups
* Interpret what their behaviors may be based on the data
* Devise some strategies on how the marketing can be customized to these customer segments

### Reference

The materials I referred to in order to complete this project are from the Machine Learning A-Z course and Customer segmentation with Python article on Towards Data Science \([https://towardsdatascience.com/customer-segmentation-with-python-31dca5d5bdad](https://towardsdatascience.com/customer-segmentation-with-python-31dca5d5bdad)\)
